## üîÑ Remaining Tasks

### 1. Create Missing Training Data Files
Based on categories.tsx, the following training data files still need to be created:

- [ ] `beerWineSpirits.ts` - Beer, Wine & Spirits category (100+ items)
- [ ] `beautyPersonalCare.ts` - Beauty & Personal Care category (100+ items)
- [ ] `lifestyle.ts` - Lifestyle category (100+ items)
- [ ] `healthWellness.ts` - Health & Wellness category (100+ items)
- [ ] `electronics.ts` - Electronics category (100+ items)
- [ ] `petSupplies.ts` - Pet Supplies category (100+ items)

### 2. Update Category Classifier
- [ ] Update `categoryClassifier.ts` to import and use the new training data structure
- [ ] Create a consolidated training data aggregator that imports all category files
- [ ] Update the TRAINING_DATA constant to use the new modular structure
- [ ] Ensure category labels match the ones in `categories.tsx`
- [ ] Test the updated classifier with the new comprehensive training data

### 3. Remove Old Training Data
- [ ] Remove the old `trainingData.ts` file (contains only partial data)
- [ ] Update any imports that reference the old training data file

### 4. Create Training Data Index File
- [ ] Create `src/utils/trainingData/index.ts` to export all training data
- [ ] Aggregate all category training data into a single export
- [ ] Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces are exported

### 5. Update Category Mapping
- [ ] Ensure category IDs in training data match category IDs in `categories.tsx`:
  - `general` ‚Üí General
  - `baby` ‚Üí Baby, Child & Toys
  - `produce` ‚Üí Fruits & Vegetables
  - `dairy` ‚Üí Dairy, Chilled & Eggs
  - `meat` ‚Üí Meat & Seafood
  - `bakery` ‚Üí Bakery & Fast Food
  - `rice` ‚Üí Rice, Noodles & Ingredients
  - `snacks` ‚Üí Snacks & Confectionery
  - `frozen` ‚Üí Frozen
  - `drinks` ‚Üí Drinks
  - `alcohol` ‚Üí Beer, Wine & Spirits
  - `beauty` ‚Üí Beauty & Personal Care
  - `lifestyle` ‚Üí Lifestyle
  - `health` ‚Üí Health & Wellness
  - `household` ‚Üí Household & Cleaning
  - `electronics` ‚Üí Electronics
  - `pet` ‚Üí Pet Supplies

### 6. Quality Assurance
- [ ] Verify each category has at least 100 unique items
- [ ] Check for duplicate item names across categories
- [ ] Ensure all training data follows the same format: `{ text: string, label: string }`
- [ ] Test category classification accuracy with the new training data

### 7. API Integration
- [ ] Create API endpoint for auto-labeling item categories
- [ ] Implement model training pipeline (if needed)
- [ ] Add category prediction confidence scores
- [ ] Create UI integration for auto-category suggestions

### 8. Documentation
- [ ] Update README with new training data structure
- [ ] Document the category classification API
- [ ] Add examples of how to add new training data
- [ ] Document the category mapping system

### 9. Testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for category classifier
- [ ] Test with real-world Singapore grocery items
- [ ] Validate classification accuracy across all categories
- [ ] Performance testing with large training datasets

### 10. Deployment
- [ ] Push completed training data to GitHub
- [ ] Deploy updated classifier to production
- [ ] Monitor classification performance in production
- [ ] Gather user feedback on auto-categorization accuracy

## üìä Progress Summary

**Training Data Files:** 10/16 completed (62.5%)
**Categories with 100+ items:** 10/17 completed (58.8%)
**Missing categories:** 6 (Beer Wine Spirits, Beauty Personal Care, Lifestyle, Health Wellness, Electronics, Pet Supplies)

## üéØ Next Priority

1. **Create remaining 6 training data files** - This will complete the training data collection phase
2. **Update categoryClassifier.ts** - Critical for making the new training data functional
3. **Create training data index file** - Needed for proper module organization
4. **Test and validate** - Ensure the classifier works with the new comprehensive dataset

## üìù Notes

- Each training data file should contain 100+ unique items minimum
- Focus on Singapore-specific items where applicable
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across all files
- Ensure no duplicate items across different categories
- The 'General' category should be excluded from having training data as per requirements
